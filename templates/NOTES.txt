                     CONGRATULATIONS!

The {{ include "k2hr3.clusterName" . }} K2HR3 Cluster for K2HDKC DBaaS has been started.

Follow the steps below to complete the K2HR3 Cluster setup.

{{- if .Values.minikube }}

[0] You are using minikube
    You need to use a browser to access the K2HR3 Cluster running
    inside minikube.
    Therefore, enable socat to forward HTTPS requests as shown
    below.(You can also use something other than socat.)

    socat TCP-LISTEN:32443,fork TCP:$(minikube ip):32443
    socat TCP-LISTEN:31443,fork TCP:$(minikube ip):31443

{{- end }}

[1] Check {{ include "k2hr3.clusterName" . }} K2HR3 Cluster
    At first, check if you have access to the K2HR3 Cluster.
    Please access the following URL after a while after starting.

    K2HR3 API:
      https://{{ include "k2hr3.r3apiExtHostname" . }}:{{ include "k2hr3.r3apiExtPort" . }}/

    K2HR3 APP:
      https://{{ include "k2hr3.r3appExtHostname" . }}:{{ include "k2hr3.r3appExtPort" . }}/

    [NOTE]
      Since a self-signed certificate is used, a certificate
      exception will occur, so please access accordingly.

[2] Get K2HR3 Unscoped Token
    After completing the above checks, log in to your K2HR3 Cluster.

    After logging in, select the [Account] -> [About Account]
    menu to display the [Account Information] dialog.
    Make a copy of the [Unscoped Token] in this displayed dialog.
    Use this value when setting up K2HDKC DBaaS.

Next, use Helm to launch K2HDKC DBaaS.
